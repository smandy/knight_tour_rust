* A Knights Tour

  Been writing this in most languages as a way of gauging how to
  implement the same problem using different idioms.

  Rust channels seem to work well for communication between threads.

  Was a lot easier to use channel than to interact with SDL directly
  by posting it an event. Suspect using channel will be a lot more
  flexible as will allow other use cases ( Network etc!).
